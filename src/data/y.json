V, which graphically originated from \u03a5; v. the letters U and V). Thus, according to the express testimony of Cicero (Or. 48, 160), Ennius always wrote Burrus for Pyrrhus, and Bruges for Phryges; and so the words which were identical in Greek and Latin in the oldest period of the language have either preserved u where the Greek has \u03c5, as bucina and \u03b2\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u0341\u03bd\u03b7, cubus and \u03ba\u03c5\u0341\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, fuga and \u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u03b7\u0341, mus and \u03bc\u03c5\u0342\u03c2 et saep.; or this u has given place to i, as in lacrima, formerly lacruma, = \u03b4\u03b1\u0341\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1. Sometimes, also, o took the place of the \u03c5; cf. mola and \u03bc\u03c5\u0341\u03bb\u03b7, sorex and \u03c5\u0314\u0341\u03c1\u03b1\u03be, folium and \u03c6\u03c5\u0341\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, and, shortening a long vowel, anc\u014fra and \u03b1\u0313\u0341\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1, like lacr\u012dma and \u03b4\u03b1\u0341\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u0342\u03bc\u03b1. In Cicero's time y seems to have been already in use; but its application was restricted to foreign words, and hence the spellings Sylla, Tybris, pyrum, satyra, etc., are to be rejected.",
